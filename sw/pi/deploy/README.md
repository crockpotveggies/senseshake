# Pi 4 deployment

The supplied overlay targets the current Pi 4 / BCM2711 design. Do not assume
the same GPIO chip or controller configuration on a Pi 5. This is an explicit
bring-up procedure; no workstation boot configuration is changed by the lab.

1. Build `senseshake-t1.dtbo` with `dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o
   senseshake-t1.dtbo senseshake-t1-overlay.dts` on the Pi. Install the result
   under `/boot/firmware/overlays/` and add `dtoverlay=senseshake-t1` to the
   `[pi4]` section of `/boot/firmware/config.txt`. Ensure the following settings
   are not unintentionally restricted by that section.
2. Remove conflicting SPI chip-select overlays. Do not enable `w1-gpio` or
   `pps-gpio` on BCM4: it is now the geophone DRDY signal. Do not
   enable a kernel IMU driver on the same SPI devices.
3. Reboot. Load `spidev` and `i2c-dev` with `sudo modprobe spidev` and
   `sudo modprobe i2c-dev`. Run `python3 bind_spi.py` to verify all five device
   identities, then `sudo python3 bind_spi.py --apply`. The script will not
   detach a different driver. Repeat binding after a reboot.
4. Verify `/dev/spidev0.0` through `.4`, `/dev/i2c-1`, and the GPIO line mapping
   with `gpioinfo`. Grant the acquisition user access using the Pi's spi/i2c/gpio
   groups. Check the example JSON against the actual chip before using it.
5. From the repository, run `python sw/tools/sensor.py live --fifo --profile
   sw/pi/profiles/t1.example.json --seconds 60 --output sw/build/bench-001.ssrec`.
   Use a new output filename each time. Start with the FPGA supply off.

Chip-select order is BCM8,7,5,6,13. IRQ order is BCM27,22,23,24. Sensor OE is
BCM26; geophone DRDY is BCM4 (currently polled over I2C). IRQs are rising-edge hints, backed by a 20 ms periodic drain
so an event missed while servicing the FIFO does not strand data. The application
requests GPIO inputs without a bias; the board drives them through U42.

T1-GEO uses the ADS122C04 at I2C address 0x40. Remove `pps` from old profiles.
The active profile has no GNSS and rejects `--utc`. Geophone conversion counters
report gaps, but polling timestamps do not establish exact sample times.
Conversion gaps do not reset a healthy ADC; real bus faults still trigger bounded
recovery. The [pre-fab stress review](../../../docs/pre-fab-review.md) demonstrates
that current polling does not preserve every conversion under the modeled load.
Dedicated falling-edge DRDY acquisition is the next software step; do not enable
400 kHz merely to claim lossless capture. That speed also needs electrical testing.
Physical qualification follows the [bench procedure](../../../docs/bench-procedure.md).

Build/merge checks run against a small controller fixture. They establish overlay
structure, not a boot test of Raspberry Pi OS or the connected devices.
