`ato.yaml` owns the build targets. `elec/` owns connectivity; `layout*.json` owns
placement metadata. `boards/` contains routed deliverables, BOMs and rendered
previews. `libraries/` and `models/` are shared dependencies with relative CAD
references. Stack concept boards are visualization artifacts, not fabrication
boards.

Use the root portable lab for routine checks. See the [build guide](../docs/build.md),
[Trenz guide](../docs/trenz-hat.md) and [validation limits](../docs/validation.md)
before invoking the lower-level authoring tools.
