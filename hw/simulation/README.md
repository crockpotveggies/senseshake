# A2 simulation scope

The FPGA carrier has fourteen additional bounded checks in `trenz/`, run with
`python3 hw/tools/simulate_trenz.py`. These cover DC input budgets, detection of
excessive supply-lead resistance and lumped UART RC loads. They do not simulate
the Trenz regulators or FPGA logic; see [T1 scope](../../docs/trenz-hat.md).
The updated source envelope is 3.35 V ±0.5% at J83 with a 30 mΩ total hot loop
resistance limit. Four load-step cases add 50/200 nH, 20 mΩ capacitor ESR and
26.4 μF effective capacitance for 0.1↔3 A ramps lasting 100 μs. They do not
qualify sub-microsecond FPGA load edges, startup inrush or source control loops.

Run `python3 hw/tools/simulate.py` with ngspice. It writes all 27 circuit decks,
simulator logs and measured limits to `results.json`, failing on a missing or
out-of-range measurement.

| Cases | Model | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | Sensor rail 3.18/3.42 V; source resistance 0.05/0.2 ohm; 500 nH trace; 22 uF bulk at 40/100% effective capacitance; 1 uF aggregate local bypass; 20–200 mA steps | 3.0–3.6 V |
| 4 | USB 4.75/5.25 V, 25/50 mA; 2 ohm cable plus 1 ohm PTC; ideal LDO with 0.4 V headroom; 0.5 ohm sensor switch, 1–25 mA sensor steps | LDO input ≥4.35 V; sensor rail ≥3.20 V |
| 3 | 4.7 kohm +1% I2C pull-up; 50/100/200 pF; 20 ohm open-drain switch | Rise <1 us, low <0.4 V; 100 kHz bus target |
| 1 | 2 Mbaud UART; 47 ohm series, assumed 25 ohm driver and 100 pF | Rise <50 ns; mid-bit high >2.31 V |
| 2 | USB CC 5.1 kohm ±1% pull-down with a 56 kohm source pull-up at 5 V | CC 0.40–0.43 V |
| 8 | Buck power stage: 4.75/5.25 V; 50/600 mA; 4.7 uH ±20%; 31.2 mohm DCR; 26.4 uF effective output capacitance; 0.1 ohm shunt; 45 mohm core connection | Chip rail 3.0–3.6 V; ripple <100 mV; peak inductor current <2 A |
| 1 | Behavioral 200 ms reset release; actual 10 kohm pull-up; assumed 30 pF | Valid low before release, high afterwards |

These are **behavioral/passive support-circuit models**, not full sensor or
Coldfoot silicon models. The buck uses complementary switches with specified
on-resistances and fixed duty adjusted for input voltage. It does not model the
AP63203 compensation, PFM, protection, startup overshoot or load-step recovery.
The sensor supply assumes a regulated source; it does not simulate TLV1117 loop
stability. Reset timing is nominal, not a supervisor tolerance model. Parasitics
are assumed bounds, not extracted PCB values. UART RC analysis is not IBIS/SI signoff.

The LDO thermal budget assumes 200 mA, 5.25 V input, 3.18 V output, 60 °C ambient
and **100 °C/W assumed board thermal resistance**: 101.4 °C estimated junction.
This is not a measured temperature. Coldfoot has a 600 mA total design envelope,
with at most 500 mA through the two core contacts and 300 mA through any contact.
Its actual current remains to be measured.

Bench work must cover capacitor DC-bias derating, regulator startup/stability,
clock edges at the chip, reset/brownout, maximum-activity rail droop, cable
hot-plug/ESD, magnetic noise with the Pi and accelerator active, GNSS RF layout
and pressure-sensor pneumatics. These checks do not establish fabrication release.
