# DAQHAT-01 physical bench procedure and report

**DAQHAT-01 revision:** GNSS is removed; one external Racotech vertical geophone
uses an ADS122C04 input. See [current circuit, acquisition and validation](geophone-input.md).
GNSS/PPS/RF details below describe the preceding revision or legacy recordings.
The current DAQHAT-01 physical bench template is version 3, with geophone
response/noise/timing and internal FPGA programming/transport checks. Version 2
reports cannot qualify this revision; create a new report and retain old evidence
with its original hardware revision.

This procedure qualifies the assembled Pi/DAQHAT-01/Trenz stack. It is separate from
preparing a prototype fabrication submission. Physical tests run when an assembly
exists; missing physical evidence is recorded as incomplete, not fabricated by a
simulation. The user owns fabrication approval.

## Prepare the report and instruments

Create one report folder under ignored `sw/build/` or dedicated lab storage.
Keep authored procedures here and raw captures outside Git. Retain the completed
report and its attachments with the hardware revision when the bench run ends.

```sh
mkdir -p sw/build/bench-001
python sw/tools/bench.py init sw/build/bench-001/report.json
python sw/tools/bench.py check sw/build/bench-001/report.json
```

The initial check intentionally returns **incomplete**, exit code 2. Record the
operator, UTC date, board serial/revision, software commit, Pi/kernel, geophone serial and calibration,
FPGA bitstream or explicit unconfigured state, instruments/calibration references,
mounting, cooling, temperature range, sample/filter settings and power cases.
Enter application targets for geophone timing error and input noise, inter-IMU skew, acceleration noise,
thermal bias change and FPGA noise ratio before evaluating those tests.

Use a current-limited adjustable supply, DMM, oscilloscope with suitable differential
voltage/current measurements, electronic load, logic analyzer, temperature probes,
calipers and a low-noise differential signal source. Timing qualification needs a
shared instrument timebase of known accuracy. Motion tests also need known
orientations and a reference accelerometer/shaker for frequency/phase characterization.

Store scope exports, logic traces, `.ssrec` recordings, analyzer JSON and fit photos
inside the report folder. Generate each evidence entry with:

```sh
python sw/tools/bench.py evidence sw/build/bench-001/report.json sw/build/bench-001/trace.csv
```

Copy the returned relative path/hash into the relevant check's `evidence` list.
Every measured check needs evidence. The checker rejects missing/altered attachments,
outside-folder paths and wrong units. Files are capped at 64 MiB each. It checks
supplied measurements and evidence integrity; it cannot certify instrument setup
or infer physical truth from a filename.

## 1. Power and partial-power operation

1. Inspect assembly/polarity/shorts unpowered. Begin with Trenz unconfigured and
   external power current limited. J83 pin 1 is positive, pin 2 ground. Use the
   documented 3.35 V ±0.5% source; the Pi sensor supply remains separate.
2. Capture cold startup at J83, the module management rail and the sequenced I/O
   rail, plus input current and reset/enable/PGOOD where accessible. Evaluate
   ramp/sequence/reset behavior against the installed Trenz revision and regulator
   documentation. The ordinary operating minimum is not a requirement at t=0.
3. Once operating, measure minimum/maximum module management voltage during idle,
   intended FPGA load, Pi stress and 0.1↔3 A characterized load steps. Record
   actual edge rates and ringing. The simulation's 100 µs ramp is not a substitute
   for faster measured switching behavior. Avoid double-counting FPGA plus dummy
   load: the total initial operating envelope is 3 A.
4. After thermal settling, measure the complete positive-and-ground loop drop
   differentially at a known current: R = ΔV/I. Include connectors, fuse, copper
   and return paths. Record probe locations and uncertainty.
5. Repeat Pi-only, FPGA-only, both-powered and both turn-on/off orders. Capture
   leakage/back-power, reset/OE levels and interface behavior against component
   limits. Summarize `power_sequence` and `partial_power_isolation` only after all
   cases are covered, with individual traces in the evidence.

Fixed report limits: operating module rail **3.201–3.399 V** and hot loop
**≤0.030 Ω**. If limits fail, correct supply/path/decoupling/protection and repeat
affected cases. Document measured inrush and component temperatures in the notes;
they are evaluated against the actual component ratings, not invented thresholds.

## 2. Mechanical fit

Assemble the intended Pi, SSQ riser, DAQHAT-01, Trenz, cooler and four straight supports.
Check full socket engagement and pin orientation, spacer seating without board
bow, fastener clearance, geophone/power-plug withdrawal and cooling access. The
internal FPGA link needs no ribbon cables or external JTAG connector. Measure
closest gaps and record photos. The nominal Pi-to-HAT gap is 27.179 mm; fit depends
on actual socket seating/cooler/cables. A dimensioned mock-up can precede assembly.
Set `connector_cable_cooler_fit=true` only after the intended configuration fits.

## 2a. Internal FPGA programming and transport

1. Follow the [host-link bring-up](fpga-host-link.md#bring-up) on the selected Pi 4
   and kernel. Record JTAG IDCODE, actual TCK frequency and successful volatile
   programming of the recorded bitstream. Set `fpga_jtag_programming=true` only
   after the real scan/load passes; a simulated mailbox is insufficient.
2. Capture BCM25 arm, switch select/request/OE, SCLK/CS and JTAG at both sides
   during SPI-to-JTAG-to-SPI transitions, startup, normal termination and recovery
   from a control-bus failure. Confirm isolation before ownership/direction
   changes. Check Pi-only and FPGA-only power in section 1, including rail ramps.
   Record `fpga_mode_handoff` separately from `partial_power_isolation`. SIGKILL
   and loss of the host have no hardware watchdog; exercise the documented
   disarm/reboot recovery before manually changing ownership.
3. Measure the signals **at the FPGA-side pins**, including the switch and series
   resistors. Enter maximum SPI clock (initially 1 kHz–1 MHz), minimum SCLK high
   and low (each at least 500 ns), and minimum CS setup/hold/inactive (each at
   least 1000 ns). Include instrument uncertainty. The checker enforces these
   conservative bring-up limits; Linux overlay settings alone are not evidence.
   Inspect overshoot, ringing, logic levels and MISO output release against the
   actual devices' limits; retain scope traces and interpretation with the report.
4. Run a recorded loopback soak covering payload lengths 0–192, sequence wrap,
   repeated mode handoffs and concurrent sensor/CPU/storage load. Record duration,
   transaction count, payload seeds, voltage/temperature and all errors. Require
   `fpga_loopback_errors=0` for this valid-traffic soak; report deliberately injected
   faults and recovery separately. A numerical zero without captures and test
   conditions does not establish a bit-error-rate guarantee.

## 3. Geophone, IRQ and acquisition timing

1. Follow [Pi deployment](../sw/pi/deploy/README.md) and capture with `--fifo`.
   The DAQHAT-01 has no GNSS and rejects `--utc`. Read back ADC configuration;
   retain raw counts, conversion counters and host monotonic timestamps.
2. Capture ADC DRDY, I²C transactions, IMU IRQ and SPI activity on a common
   logic-analyzer timebase. Measure conversion-to-read delay, delivered rate,
   latency variation, inter-IMU skew and drift under CPU/storage/network load,
   with the FPGA off, idle and active. The current ADC driver polls; it does
   not turn DRDY into a hardware timestamp.
3. Stop/resume acquisition deliberately. Confirm IMU FIFO behavior and that
   ADC overwrites, integrity faults and ambiguous counter wraps produce faults
   with unknown physical loss. The ADC has no FIFO. Confirm recovery without
   relabeling invalid or saturated samples as valid.
4. Apply calibrated differential inputs within the ADC common-mode and input
   limits, including a 10 Hz sine and a frequency sweep. Measure polarity,
   gain, clipping and recovery. Independently move the vertical geophone with
   a known reference to establish its mechanical response and polarity. An
   electrical signal-generator test alone does not calibrate the geophone.
5. Populate `geophone_polarity_response`, measured maximum geophone timing
   error, inter-IMU skew and recovery checks with the retained traces. Choose
   timing limits from the research use case before evaluating acceptance.

Start with 10 minutes per load state and repeated cold starts, then extend
through thermal settling and the intended operating envelope. No absolute UTC
qualification is implied by this board or a passing relative timing test.

## 4. Noise, thermal drift and FPGA coupling

Record identical sensor settings and rigid mounting with FPGA off, idle and active;
repeat with cooling off/on where thermally permissible. Keep external vibrations
and temperature traces as controlled as practical. Retain thermal settling and
stable intervals separately. Record known orientations and a reference vibration
input for axis, gain and phase checks; package axes are not automatically board axes.

```sh
python sw/tools/measure_hat.py sw/build/bench-001/off.ssrec --output sw/build/bench-001/off.json
python sw/tools/measure_hat.py sw/build/bench-001/active.ssrec \
  --baseline sw/build/bench-001/off.ssrec --output sw/build/bench-001/comparison.json
```

The existing analyzer reports nominal-SI mean, standard deviation, trend, gravity,
sample periods and gaps. It does not yet calculate spectral density or Allan
deviation. For band-limited acceptance, use a documented filter/spectral analysis
and retain its script/settings/output as evidence. Enter worst-axis RMS over the
declared common band, worst thermal bias change and worst active/off noise ratio.
Do not compare runs with different sample/filter settings or use motion-contaminated
standard deviation as a stationary noise floor. Reference calibration and absolute
accuracy remain distinct from repeatability/noise.

## Evaluate and prepare the prototype release

```sh
python sw/tools/bench.py check sw/build/bench-001/report.json
```

Exit 0 means every supplied measurement/evidence item and application limit passes;
exit 2 means incomplete or failed checks; exit 1 means malformed input. Missing
measurements, targets, context or evidence never become a pass. Correct failed
items and repeat the affected tests with traceable revisions.

For the next **prototype fab submission**, freeze the intended DAQHAT-01 revision and
actual stack/copper/dielectric values; use the current
[hardening review](daqhat-01-link-hardening.md) and internal-link assembly;
run the full CAD/build checks; review footprint pin numbering, BOM availability,
DNPs, drill/microvia instructions and mechanical fit; then export and independently
inspect Gerbers/drills, assembly drawings and placements from that same revision.
Retain hashes and a release manifest. Fabrication data has not been exported or
submitted by this software task. Keep the physical bench report pending until
boards arrive, rather than requiring completed-board measurements before making
the first prototype.

For geophone noise, record both a shorted differential input and the connected,
stationary sensor. Convert counts to input volts using the recorded gain and
reference. Measure the defined bandwidth with FPGA off/idle/active and record
`max_geophone_input_noise_rms` against the application target. Separate ambient
ground motion from electronic noise; do not use the synthetic stimulus as evidence.
