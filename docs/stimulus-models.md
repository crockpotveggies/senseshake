# Virtual sensor stimulus models

`ideal-v1` replaces the old fixed counter patterns with controllable, time-based
signals. It runs through the same acquisition, validation, calibration and
recording code as the live drivers. No browser UI is required yet; the scenario
API is ready for a UI controller to schedule changes.

## Try the example

The [demo scenario](../sw/pi/profiles/stimulus-demo.json) combines rocking and
vibration, magnetic drift/a pulse, a separately rotated remote head, a pressure
wave/overrange step and GNSS movement/fix loss.

```sh
python sw/tools/sensor.py simulate --remote --seconds 2 --seed 7 \
  --scenario sw/pi/profiles/stimulus-demo.json --output sw/build/stimulus.ssrec
python sw/tools/sensor.py replay sw/build/stimulus.ssrec
python sw/tools/sensor.py export-scenario sw/build/stimulus.ssrec \
  --output sw/build/saved-scenario.json
```

Use the schema/runtime setup in the [software guide](sensor-software.md).
Alternatively, `./lab.ps1 test -Profile software` runs the models and retains a
demo in the existing bounded lab results. That demo combines this scenario with
the older sample-index fault fixture. Direct outputs use exclusive creation.

Re-run an exported scenario with the same seed, `--remote` setting, duration,
queue settings and any separate `--faults` fixture to reproduce a run. Export
prints the recorded seed and remote setting. It recovers stimulus controls,
including timed faults; separate sample-index fault fixtures remain separate.
`replay` validates existing samples; `simulate` generates a fresh experiment.

## Scenario format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "initial": {
    "orientation_deg": [0, 0, 0],
    "acceleration_m_s2": [{"amplitude": 0.2, "frequency_hz": 3}, 0, 0],
    "pressure_pa": {"amplitude": 4, "frequency_hz": 1, "noise_peak": 0.05}
  },
  "events": [
    {"at_ns": 1000000000, "set": {"orientation_deg": [0, 30, 0]}},
    {"at_ns": 2000000000, "set": {"sensor_faults": {"1": "disconnect"}}},
    {"at_ns": 2200000000, "set": {"sensor_faults": {}}}
  ]
}
```

Omitted controls use defaults. An event replaces only the named controls; a
vector or fault map is replaced as a whole. Events are chronological, apply at
`time >= at_ns`, and preserve file order when timestamps match. Waves use global
simulation time, so replacing a waveform does not restart its phase or drift.
The CLI advances in 1 ms ticks; control events are recorded before acquisition
on the first tick at/after their requested time. Requested time and recorded
application time are both retained. A sample sees the state at its own time.

| Control | Units/meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orientation_deg` | HAT roll, pitch, yaw; three numbers or smooth waveforms | `[0,0,0]` |
| `head_orientation_deg` | Independent remote-head roll, pitch, yaw | `[0,0,0]` |
| `acceleration_m_s2` | World east/north/up linear acceleration, excluding gravity; three signals | `[0,0,0]` |
| `magnetic_ut` | World east/north/up field, microtesla; three signals | `[0,20,-45]` |
| `pressure_pa` | Differential pressure; scalar signal | `0` |
| `temperature_c` | IMU/inclinometer temperature; scalar signal | `25` |
| `pressure_temperature_count` | Explicit unsigned 11-bit DLVR temperature fixture | `768` |
| `gnss_position` | Origin latitude degrees, longitude degrees, height metres; numbers only | `[49,-123,0]` |
| `gnss_velocity_ned_m_s` | Constant north/east/down velocity until changed | `[0,0,0]` |
| `gnss_fix` | Boolean 3D fix / no fix | `true` |
| `sensor_faults` | Map of sensor ID strings `"1"`…`"8"` to held fault actions | `{}` |

Signals accept a constant number or these optional waveform fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `offset` | Constant baseline in the control's units |
| `amplitude`, `frequency_hz`, `phase_deg` | Sine wave amplitude, frequency and phase |
| `drift_per_s` | Linear change per second since simulation time zero |
| `noise_peak` | Peak of deterministic uniform measurement noise |
| `pulse_start_s`, `pulse_duration_s`, `pulse_amplitude` | Added rectangular pulse, start inclusive/end exclusive |

All omitted waveform fields are zero. Orientation signals allow sine/drift but
exclude noise and rectangular pulses, because those have no finite angular-rate
derivative. A timed pose change is an instantaneous repositioning; it does not
invent a gyro impulse. Use a smooth orientation waveform to test rotation rates.
Noise is keyed by seed, sensor ID, field/axis and time. Sensor read order, retries
and unrelated streams cannot perturb its random sequence. Same-runtime repeats
are byte-identical; cross-platform math-library bit identity is not promised.

Fault actions are `none`, `timeout`, `nack`, `disconnect`, `not_ready`,
`saturation`, and `short_read`. They persist until replaced and enter the normal
bounded recovery path. `none` overrides a simultaneous sample-index fault;
an absent sensor entry falls back to `--faults`. Clearing an input fault does
not bypass the application's cooldown or replenish its restart budget.
GNSS fix loss is controlled by `gnss_fix`, not `saturation`.

## Physical model and raw encoding

World axes are east/north/up, with package axes aligned at zero orientation.
Orientation uses `Rz(yaw) Ry(pitch) Rx(roll)`. Acceleration is linear acceleration
plus an upward 9.80665 m/s² gravity contribution, rotated into package axes.
The four IMUs share motion, with independent noise when requested. Gyro rates
come from the analytic Euler-angle derivatives, including tilted-axis coupling.

LSM6DSO encoding uses nominal selected-range sensitivities and signed 16-bit
counts. SCL3300 encodes acceleration using the selected mode and tilt angles
from the acceleration direction, with 16384 counts per 90 degrees. Zero
acceleration/freefall makes tilt undefined and yields FAULT. Temperature follows
the respective nominal register transfer functions. Sensor full-scale excess
or count-rail clipping is marked SATURATED; raw integers stay inside wire bounds.

The RM3100 model rotates the field using the **remote** orientation, applies a
nominal 75 counts/µT at cycle count 200 and clips signed 24-bit counts. Other
cycle counts are rejected until their transfer model is specified. This gain
is a simulation assumption, not fitted calibration or magnetic performance
qualification. It models count rails, not a validated magnetic full-scale limit.

Pressure maps the configured min/max Pa to 10%/90% of the 14-bit count span.
Outside the configured span it reports SATURATED; at ADC limits it clips rather
than wraps. Both status bits remain normal for VALID/SATURATED response payloads.
The explicit 11-bit temperature count is packed with five zero padding bits;
no pressure-temperature conversion is claimed.

GNSS integrates piecewise constant NED velocity in a local tangent approximation
using a 6378137 m radius and longitude scale at the origin latitude. Velocity
changes preserve position; a new `gnss_position` resets the origin/displacement.
NAV-PVT contains iTOW, coordinates, height, velocity, heading and fix flags.
No-fix messages are successfully acquired raw data with invalid navigation
flags, not MISSING bus measurements. UTC validity is never asserted. Ellipsoid
and mean-sea-level heights are equal in this model; there is no geoid model.

These are application stimuli, not sensor silicon or environmental emulation.
They omit filtering/FIFO delays, sensor placement lever arms, actual package-to-PCB
mounting transforms, thermal drift physics, magnetic hysteresis, acoustic plumbing
and GNSS RF/orbital effects. Acceleration, GNSS velocity and position can be
controlled independently; they do not form a solved rigid-body trajectory.
Signals above sample Nyquist frequency alias normally; no resampling or
anti-alias filter is silently added. SCL3300 mode-specific accuracy near tilt
limits is not modeled.

## UI integration, traceability and limits

`Scenario.schedule(at_ns, changes)` validates an atomic future update;
`advance(now)` returns each due update once for the recorder. Send UI commands
to the acquisition thread, schedule beyond its last advanced time, then record
each update through `Acquisition.event("stimulus_change", ..., **change)` before
sampling. This API does not start a server or claim thread safety. The recording
header includes `ideal-v1`, initial scenario and seed; events capture controls
added after startup. `export-scenario` combines both into reusable JSON.

Limits: 64 KiB input JSON, 8192-byte normalized scenario, 256 events, 1536 bytes per event, one-hour
time horizon, frequency ≤500 Hz, finite waveform coefficients ≤1e6 magnitude,
nonnegative noise/pulse duration, initial latitude within ±85°, and NED velocities
within ±300 m/s. Polar trajectory excursions beyond ±89.9° fail the GNSS read.
Unknown fields and invalid values fail validation before acquisition. The v1
Protobuf contract and existing acquisition/file/queue limits are unchanged.

Tests check independent level/tilted/raw-count expectations, gyro derivatives,
remote orientation, sensor ranges, pulse boundaries, deterministic noise,
GNSS wire offsets/motion/fix loss, bounded transactional scheduling, timed faults,
recorded control events, export and byte-identical CLI regeneration.
